== Frequently Asked Questions ==
- Are there any requirements
  - Yes, woocommerce is required for this plugin to work.



- The coupon is off by a few cents sometimes
  - This can happen if there is a total that cannot be divided evenly by the number of products in the cart. There is no way around this, sadly it is a math issue.



- Where do I find the setup page?
  - Exactly where coupons normally are, Admin -> Marketing -> Coupons



- Can I donate?
  - Yes, I have a ko-fi page here [https://ko-fi.com/P5P22RTZ6](https://ko-fi.com/P5P22RTZ6). I would greatly appreciate it being a college student :)



- I am a developer, can I contribute?
  - There is a github page here: [https://github.com/pilotkid/wp-coupon-highest-priced-item](https://github.com/pilotkid/wp-coupon-highest-priced-item)



- How can I disable the Ko-Fi donate button?
  - If you look under Settings->General there is an option to hide the Ko-Fi message
