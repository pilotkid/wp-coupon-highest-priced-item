== Description ==

This plugin allows you to create a coupon that will apply a percentage based coupon to the highest priced item in a user's cart.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `Woo-Coupon-For-Highest-Priced-Item-In-Cart.zip` file to the plugins section of your wordpress site
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
- Are there any requirements
  - Yes, woocommerce is required for this plugin to work.

  - This can happen if there is a total that cannot be divided evenly by the number of products in the cart. There is no way around this, sadly it is a math issue.

- Where do I find the setup page?
  - Exactly where coupons normally are, Admin -> Marketing -> Coupons

- Can I donate?
  - Yes, I have a ko-fi page here https://ko-fi.com/P5P22RTZ6. I would greatly appreciate it being a college student :)

- I am a developer, can I contribute?
  - There is a github page here: https://github.com/pilotkid/wp-coupon-highest-priced-item
